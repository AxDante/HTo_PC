# MSR_waypoint_navigation

MSR_waypoint_navigation is a MATLAB path planning program developed for modular self reconfigurable robots (MSRs). Given a set of robot target waypoints, the program returns the best visiting sequence that yields the lowest navigation cost. The question is modeled as a typical travelling salesman problem (TSP). Path-planning techniques like A-Star(A*) are implemented in this program to solve for potential solutions. The program provides real-time navigation simulation in MATLAB with visual display of robot path and navigation heatmap. Preview images of the simulation are shown below.
